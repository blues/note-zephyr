# Examples

## Getting started

These examples demonstrate how to use the Notecard with Zephyr. Examples include:

- [blinky](./blinky/README.md) - Toggle an LED and sends a Note to the Notecard with the status of the LED. A modification of Zephyr's Blinky example.
- [message queues](./message-queues/README.md) - Demonstrates how to use the Zephyr's Message Queue API to send and receive messages across threads while handling real-time events and offloading the data to Notecard for cloud upload.
- [binary](./binary/README.md) - Demonstrates how to send and receive binary data to and from the Notecard (and to and from Notehub).
